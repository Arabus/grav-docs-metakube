Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes which makes it easy to install common applications like an [Ingress Controller](../15.create-an-ingress-controller/default.en.md) into your Kubernetes cluster.

## Installation

See the official Helm [installation guide](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-helm).
