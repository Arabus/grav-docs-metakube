To delete a worker node, navigate to `Manage cluster` and choose the cluster, from which you want to delete a worker node from.
Click on the Trashbin button right besides the node you want to delete. You will get a popup, where you have to confirm the deletion.

Afterwards the node will be in pending status until the deletion succeeded.
