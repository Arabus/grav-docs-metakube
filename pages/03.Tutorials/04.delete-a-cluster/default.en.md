To delete a cluster, navigate to `Manage cluster` and choose the cluster that you would like to delete. On the top right is a button `delete cluster`

To confirm the deletion, type the name of the cluster into the text box

The cluster will switch into deletion state afterwards, and will be removed from the list when the deletion succeeded.
