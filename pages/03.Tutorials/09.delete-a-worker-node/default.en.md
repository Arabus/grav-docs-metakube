To delete a worker node, navigate to `Manage cluster` and choose the cluster that you want to delete a worker node from. Click on the trashbin button right next to the node you want to delete. You will get a popup where you have to confirm the deletion

Afterwards the node will be in pending status until the deletion succeeded.
