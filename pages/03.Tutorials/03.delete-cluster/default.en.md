To delete a cluster, navigate to `Manage cluster` and choose the cluster, which you want to delete. On the top right is a button `delete cluster`:

To confirm the deletion, type the name of the cluster into the textbox

The cluster will switch into deletion state afterwards, and removed from the list when the deletion succeeded.
