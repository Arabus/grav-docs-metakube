Optionally you can activate writing audit logs on a MetaKube cluster during cluster creation or in the "Edit Settings" dialog.

When activated all operations against the apiserver will be logged.

For more information se also [Auditing](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/audit/).

There is currently no self-service interface to retrieve or search these logs. If you need to access these logs, please contact our [support](../../05.support/default.en.md) and specify for which cluster and time frame you want to retrieve the logs.
